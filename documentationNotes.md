**Draft documentation**

- In this documentation document, I would like to explain what the code is doing and why I did it that way.

-- Line 9 - 12 Defining some of the hard limits set out by the question paper, keeping it here makes it more legible to you the marker.

-- Line 14 - 16 Defineing the catogories of these *cells*

-- Line 18 - 44 Generating random data and putting safeing them to an array

-- Line 46 - 68 Creating the dataframes with Panda

-- Line 69 Pandas always has this index starting at zero, and I found it super confusing, so I asked an AI about it and it informed me I could declare any colum to be the index for pandas, and I think it cleaned up how my code looks a whole lot

-- Line 71 - 74 Calculating the percentage

-- Line 76 - 78 Rounding I think it makes the output look neater and more pridicatable.
