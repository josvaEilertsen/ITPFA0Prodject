## Project Structure

- **`notebook.ipynb`**: This is my initial, super-dooper draft.
- **`MainScript.py`**: This file represents a more refined draft. It's where I start to structure the code better, implement more robust logic, and clean things up
- **`documentationNotes.md`**: A draft of the code documentation. We need to explain our coding decisions to the marker
